        <p>Dan Avidan is a musician and comedian who joined the YouTube series Game Grumps in 2013. He brings a chilled-out, positive presence to the show, and is often sent into uncontrollable fits of laughter by co-host Arin Hanson. Avidan grew up an admirer of "commentary" shows like Mystery Science Theatre 3000 and was thrilled to join Game Grumps to hone his craft and live out his comedy dreams.
